    <p>Hello, my name is <em>Marwa</em>. I was born on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April 2005. I'm an Aries. I am from <strong>Morocco</strong>, specifically from <b>Fes</b>. I grew up with my family, and when I graduated high school, I came directly to Canada to pursue my academic education in <strong>interactive media design</strong>. I want to achieve my parents' dream of becoming an independent woman, as a media designer.</p>
    <p>I have always dreamed of traveling and exploring new places, like Greece. It's one of my dream destinations, a magical place all in blue. My family and I have visited almost all the cities in Morocco, such as Marrakech, one of the beautiful cities in Morocco, full of amazing people serving amazing food and culture.</p>
